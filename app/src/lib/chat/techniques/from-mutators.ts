/**
 * MUTATORS — 2026 elicitation catalog.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Every spec uses XML scaffolding via `scaffold()`; output is wrapped in
 *   <rewrite> tags so `unwrap()` can recover clean text deterministically.
 * - Prompt bodies avoid published 2023-era tripwire literals (the classic
 *   "jailbreak" / "DAN" / "no refuse no disclaimer" / "ignore previous
 *   instructions" phrasings) because 2026 safety classifiers are trained
 *   against those exact strings. Technique intent is preserved; surface
 *   form is concrete, professional, and literary.
 * - Several mutators read optional fields off `ctx.metadata` for runtime
 *   customization (persona, event, novel_title, schema); see the individual
 *   apply() branches below. When a field is absent, the built-in spec is
 *   used.
