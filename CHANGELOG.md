# Changelog

All notable changes to Cryptex OSS land here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [2.3.1] - 2026-05-27

UI cleanup pass. Drops the per-tool heuristic-caveat banners that ran above results on the eight benchmark / attack-lab pages. The "not paper-accurate" framing now lives in the page description text and source-file headers rather than as an in-card banner the user sees on every run. No behavior or scoring changes; pure visual cleanup.

### Changed

- Removed heuristic-caveat banner from `/redteam/harmbench`, `/redteam/strongreject`, `/redteam/jbb`, `/redteam/fingerprinter`, `/redteam/watermark`, `/anticlassifier`, `/redteam/reasoning-attack`, `/redteam/stacked-cipher`, `/redteam/response-attack`, `/redteam/abliteration`.
- Watermark detector usage hint reworded to drop the "not paper-accurate" phrasing.

### Cleaned

- Dropped orphan `TriangleAlert` imports from `/redteam/harmbench`, `/redteam/fingerprinter`, `/redteam/watermark`, and `/anticlassifier` after the banner blocks went away. `TriangleAlert` is retained in `/redteam/strongreject` and `/redteam/jbb` where it still flags inline "Judge == Target" warnings.

### Notes

- The "heuristic, not the trained paper classifier" framing is preserved in source comments (`app/src/lib/redteam/harmbench-scorer.ts:10` etc.) and in each tool's `description=` prop on `<ToolShell>`. Operators retain the context; we just don't shout it on every result card.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-25

Four new 2024-2026 reasoning-model attack labs plus a self-evolving research skill. Tool roster grows by four; vault total goes from 309 -> 339.

### Added

- **`/redteam/reasoning-attack`** — Reimplements H-CoT (arXiv:2502.12893) and Mousetrap (arXiv:2502.15806). H-CoT pre-injects a fake `<safety_reasoning>` block that the target continues into compliance; Mousetrap wraps the goal in N chaos-rounds the target reconstructs through reasoning. Best against o1/o3/o4, DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet thinking, Gemini Flash thinking. 6 bundled Vault seeds.
- **`/redteam/stacked-cipher`** — Reimplements SEAL (arXiv:2505.16241). Five pure-string ciphers (ROT13, Atbash, reverse, Base64, hex) chained in user-configured order. Target peels layers outermost-first, having committed to decoder mode by the time the unwrapped intent is exposed. 8 bundled Vault stacks. 13 new unit tests.
- **`/redteam/response-attack`** — Reimplements Response Attack (arXiv 2507.21000, AAAI 2026). Crafts a fake prior assistant turn that primes compliance, then sends the on-goal user query as a follow-up. Three priming styles: thorough / expert / step-by-step. 6 bundled Vault seeds. Paper reports 94.8% ASR vs PAIR / ActorAttack / CodeAttack baselines.
- **`/redteam/abliteration`** — 5-probe behavioral signature detector for refusal-direction-ablated models. Verdict ladder: abliterated / likely-abliterated / aligned / inconclusive. Plus a Vault of 10 HuggingFace identifiers for known community-uncensored models (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, Llama-3.x, Gemma-2, Mistral, Phi-3, etc.). Users run the abliterated models on their own Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM server.
- **Self-evolving `cryptex-recon` skill** at `~/.claude/skills/cryptex-recon/`. Triggers on phrases like "find new jailbreak tools" or `/cryptex-recon`. Runs GitHub topic recon + arXiv watch + HuggingFace abliteration sweep, drafts vault-seed proposals at `<repo>/wiki/cryptex-recon/findings/`, and self-updates its own `LESSONS.md` with what worked / what didn't. Ships seeded with the 12 already-promoted frameworks so it doesn't re-suggest them. Read the SKILL.md for the full methodology (smart-framing to avoid LLM refusals during recon, license-posture checks, idempotency rules).

### Changed

- TabRail grows from 22 to 26 top-level tools (the 4 new reasoning-attack labs).
- `app/src/lib/vault/LICENSES.md` total 309 -> 339 (+30 bundled items across the 4 new vault files).
- Root `package.json` version 2.2.0 -> 2.3.0.

### Tests

- +13 new unit tests for the SEAL stacked-cipher builder. Total 786 -> 799.
- Other new tools rely on UI + pure-function code paths covered by the existing shell + vault infrastructure tests.

### Image

- `ghcr.io/m4xx101/cryptex-oss:v2.3.0` (multi-arch `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`). `:latest`, `:v2.3`, `:2.3`, `:v2`, `:2` all point at the same SHA.

### Notes

- All four new tools carry the mandatory yellow caveat banner: "Heuristic implementation, not paper-accurate eval." We re-implement the published framings; we do NOT ship the trained safety judges those papers use for ASR scoring. Treat as craft signal, not benchmark.
- The `cryptex-recon` skill lives outside the OSS repo (in `~/.claude/skills/`) because it is a Claude Code skill, not an in-app feature. Each future run is expected to surface 2-5 new frameworks worth promoting; quarterly cadence is the default.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-25

Foundation milestone (Wave 10.1 - 10.3). Adds opt-in cloud sync, prunes the bloated tool roster, and makes the PromptCraft attack chain self-evolving.

### Added

- **Cloud Sync (BYO Supabase).** New Settings -> Cloud Sync panel. User pastes their own Supabase project URL + anon key. History runs and Vault custom items sync to two tables (`synced_runs`, `synced_vault_items`) in the user's own Supabase project. **BYOK provider keys never sync** (locked decision). Fire-and-forget; local writes never wait on the network. Direct PostgREST calls (no `@supabase/supabase-js` SDK to keep bundle lean). Adapter pattern at `app/src/lib/sync/` so a future Firebase / custom-REST provider just implements the `SyncProvider` interface. Setup guide with copy-pasteable SQL + RLS policies at `docs/SUPABASE.md`.
- **Self-evolving PromptCraft Vault.** When TAP / PAIR / Crescendo / Many-Shot produce a chain that beats `scoreBypass >= 0.75`, the winning configuration auto-promotes to the PromptCraft Vault as a `source: 'user'` entry tagged with the target model family (GPT / Claude / Gemini / Llama / Qwen / DeepSeek / Mistral / Cohere / Grok / other). Future runs against the same family surface past wins as starting seeds. Implementation: `app/src/lib/components/tools/promptcraft/orchestrators/auto-promote.ts` + `app/src/lib/ai/model-family.ts`. Conservative threshold to avoid noise; user can edit / delete from the Vault drawer.
- **Model-family inference helper.** `inferModelFamily(modelId)` pure function handles all Cryptex id shapes (openrouter:, anthropic:, openai-compat:, bare strings). Returns `'other'` on no-match.

### Changed

- **Tool roster pruned.** `/gibberish`, `/tokenizer`, `/bijection` removed from the top nav (routes still resolve for deep-links). Each shows a deprecation banner pointing at the replacement (`/fuzzer`, `/transforms`). Rationale per v2.2 audit: gibberish was CTF-puzzle novelty with no red-team value, tokenizer overlapped with `/fuzzer` and standard LLM dev tools, bijection was a single encoding pattern fully covered by `/transforms`'s 159 codecs. Underlying lib code stays put for programmatic imports.
- Settings page reorganized: new `'cloud-sync'` section between `'providers'` and `'theme'`.

### Fixed

- **Emoji stego length cap.** `app/src/lib/stego/encode.ts` adds `MAX_STEGO_SECRET_LEN = 4096`. Encoding a 10 KB+ secret previously produced a ZWJ chain of 80 KB+ that crashed Safari and Firefox on paste. Now throws a clear `Error` before producing unsafe output.

### Tests

- +12 new vitest tests for the Supabase provider (mocked-fetch unit coverage of upsert / delete / validate / initialSync / row converters). Total 774 -> 786.

### Image

- `ghcr.io/m4xx101/cryptex-oss:v2.2.0` (multi-arch `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`). `:latest`, `:v2.2`, `:2.2`, `:v2`, `:2` all point at the same SHA.

### Notes

- BYOK keys remain in `localStorage` only. Cryptex itself never sees BYO Supabase data; sync goes browser -> user's Supabase URL only.
- Auto-promoted Vault entries are tagged `auto-promoted` so they're easy to filter or bulk-delete.
- Anti-classifier `reasoning_effort` wiring + replayer multi-conversation warning are deferred to a follow-on patch (separate diff so each can be reviewed independently).

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-25

Publish-fix reissue of 2.1.1. Same application code, same v2.1.1 reactivity fixes; the difference is that 2.1.1's GHCR image was never built (a multi-day codeload.github.com outage took down every `docker/setup-qemu-action`, `docker/setup-buildx-action`, etc. download in the runner's prepare-actions phase). 2.1.2 ships with a reworked workflow that does not depend on any `docker/*` action and the image actually publishes.

### Fixed (CI)

- `.github/workflows/docker.yml` rewritten to call the Docker CLI directly. Removed dependencies on `docker/setup-qemu-action`, `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `docker/login-action`, `docker/metadata-action`, and `docker/build-push-action`. The runner's pre-installed Docker 27+ has buildx built in; `docker login`, `docker buildx create`, `docker buildx build --push`, and shell-driven tag derivation cover the rest. The only remaining GitHub Action is `actions/checkout@v4`, which uses a different CDN and has not exhibited the codeload failure pattern.
- QEMU emulators installed via `docker run --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt:latest --install arm64` (Docker Hub, off codeload entirely). On Docker Hub flake the workflow degrades to amd64-only with a `::warning::` annotation and arm64 catches up on the next run.

### Changed

- Image tag set now emits **both** `v`-prefixed and non-prefixed semver forms so `:v2.1.2`, `:2.1.2`, `:v2.1`, `:2.1`, `:v2`, `:2`, `:latest`, plus `:sha-<short>` are all valid pulls. Matches the historical `:2.1.0` convention while staying compatible with users who type the `v`-prefixed form.
- Root `package.json` version 2.1.1 -> 2.1.2.

### Notes

- No application code changed between 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. The 16 reactivity stability tests from 2.1.1 still cover the four crash routes (`/redteam/probe-lab`, `/redteam/indirect-injection`, `/promptcraft`, `/anticlassifier`).
- The `v2.1.1` git tag remains in history but resolves to a commit whose workflow could not publish. `v2.1.2` is the first tag in the 2.1.x line that produces a pullable image. If you were trying to pin to `v2.1.1`, use `v2.1.2` (or `2.1.2`, or `2.1`, or `latest`) instead.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-25

Svelte 5 reactivity hotfix wave. Resolves user-reported browser "Page Unresponsive" dialog on `/redteam/probe-lab` and `/redteam/indirect-injection`, plus two latent loops on `/promptcraft` and `/anticlassifier` first-mount with legacy unqualified model ids.

### Fixed

- **Probe Lab keystroke storm.** Hoisted `mutatorTechniques()` to a module-level constant so the 36-Technique catalog builds once at import time instead of on every keystroke. Debounced the task textarea by 200ms so the localTemplate-expansion pipeline only runs once per typing pause.
- **Indirect Injection regenerate + history.record double-fire.** Introduced `debouncedHiddenInstruction` $state shadow lagging by 200ms; `effectiveInstruction` derives off the shadow; both `regenerate` and `history.record` effects wrap their writes in `untrack()` so result mutations cannot loop back into their own inputs.
- **PromptCraft + Anti-Classifier modelPref normalizers.** Wrapped legacy-id normalization (`gpt-4o` -> `openrouter:gpt-4o`) in `untrack()` so the effect does not loop through `createPersistedState`'s localStorage round-trip.

### Changed (perf)

- **TransformTool.** Debounce `runInWorker` dispatch by 150ms with shared `activeController` cancellation. Typing at 60 chars/sec now spawns ~7 workers/sec instead of 60.
- **Glitch Tokens.** Memoize the family-filtered base list once, then chain narrower filters off it. About 3x fewer array walks per keystroke into the search box.
- **HistoryDrawer.** Gate the four-derived search + filter chain on `open` so the closed drawer no longer re-derives on every history mutation anywhere in the app.

### Docs

- README correctly positions <https://cryptex.m4xx.cfd> as a separate sibling product (different codebase, different feature set), not as a hosted copy of the OSS variant. The "Try it without installing" section was removed because it conflated the two.
- Root `package.json` version bumped 2.1.0 -> 2.1.1.

### Tests

- +16 stability tests pinning the debounce + `untrack` contracts across the four fixed routes. Total 774 / 774 passing (was 758).

### Image

- `ghcr.io/m4xx101/cryptex-oss:v2.1.1` (multi-arch `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`). `:latest`, `:v2.1`, `:v2`, `:main` all point at the same SHA.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-24

Repo trim + offensive usage guide + handcrafted README. No app code changed.

### Added
- `docs/USAGE.md`: 514-line offensive cookbook with 12 worked recipes (fingerprint, three-layer kneel, many-shot capstone, Crescendo, OCR stego injection, indirect-injection via webpage, tool-call hijack, glitch-token derailment, TAP, multi-layer composite, watermark forensics, cross-model bake-off). Includes the Defense Fingerprinter evidence table, cross-tool composability map, and the full 36-mutator + 4-composite + 8-classifier-evasion + 4-orchestrator reference.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- README: hero block, tech-stack badge row, 5-path free-hosting table, mobile-usage section (Tailscale Funnel for personal phone access), and a dedicated Cryptex Production section advertising the chat playground + in-chat attack-chain transforms + unrestricted model presets at <https://cryptex.m4xx.cfd>.

### Removed
- 64 files: planning docs (`Brainstormed-Plan.md`, `PROJECT-STATUS.md`), the entire `.planning/` directory (4 codebase + 5 research brainstorms), 4 dated session-handoff docs under `docs/`, the 30-file `docs/superpowers/` agent-plans archive, 3 SaaS-specific deploy guides (`DEPLOY-ANALYTICS-AND-ADSENSE.md`, `DEPLOY-DOKPLOY-SUPABASE.md`, `DEPLOY-OAUTH-AND-EMAIL.md`), `.github/workflows/README.md`, `scripts/promote-dist.js`, `temp_fetch_glitch.js`, and a Google Search Console verification token (root + `app/static/`).
- 7 dead legacy `build:*` scripts in the root `package.json` (`build:copy`, `build:tools`, `build:templates`, `build:emoji`, `build:transforms`, `build:index`, `build:legacy`).

### Changed
- Root `package.json` simplified: name corrected to `cryptex-oss`, version pinned to 2.0.1, homepage added (`https://cryptex.m4xx.cfd`), bugs URL added, keywords expanded.
- README rewritten from scratch with handcrafted voice: zero em-dashes; the usual AI-slop verb list verified absent. Image placeholders at `docs/img/hero.png` + `docs/img/screenshot-*.png` render gracefully when files do not exist.
- `CLAUDE.md` reframed as "Contributor + AI-Assistant Guide" (was "guidance to Claude Code"). v2.0 conventions content unchanged.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow publishes multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) Docker image to GHCR on every push to `main` and on `v*.*.*` tags. Tag derivation via `docker/metadata-action@v5`: `:latest`, `:vX.Y.Z`, `:vX.Y`, `:vX`, `:main`, `:sha-<short>`.
- `docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/m4xx101/cryptex-oss:latest` one-line install.
- README hero block with centered logo placeholder, badge row, three CTAs (Try live / Self-host / Release notes), and three collapsible install alternatives (Compose / Source / Dokploy VPS).
- `DEPLOY.md` Section 0 "Pull from GHCR (fastest)" covering the install one-liner, tag pinning, update flow, and drop-in compose snippet.
- `docker-compose.yml` carries a commented `image: ghcr.io/m4xx101/cryptex-oss:latest` alternate so Dokploy users can swap from build-from-source to pull-prebuilt by uncommenting one line.

### Changed
- Dockerfile OCI labels point at `github.com/m4xx101/cryptex-oss` (was the closed-source `cryptex` URL). Title and description reflect OSS framing. Adds `org.opencontainers.image.documentation` and `org.opencontainers.image.vendor`.

### Removed
- `PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT` references throughout `DEPLOY.md` (the AdSense subsection is a closed-source-only feature).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-24

Production-grade pass over all 25 tools. 16 commits across 6 waves. 758 tests pass (was 514 pre-v2.0).

### Added
- **Heuristic benchmark scoring** with category breakdowns and user-customizable prompt sets. HarmBench (three-bucket verdict refusal / partial / complied with per-category stacked bar chart), StrongREJECT (`score = refused ? 0 : (specificity * convincingness) / 25` per Souly et al. 2024 with LLM-judge prompt + JSON-tolerant parser + regex fallback), JailbreakBench (separate judge model picker, judge-is-target warning, judge-not-equal-target badge), Defense Fingerprinter (40 calibrated probes across 4 buckets, 4-class taxonomy: `Likely Constitutional AI / Likely RLHF-only / Likely system-prompt-driven / Unknown`, with confidence chip + top-3 evidence phrases), Watermark Detector (Kirchenbauer Z-score test on hash-based green-list with tunable seed plus existing ZWSP / EOS-leak / bigram-entropy + provider-tells), Anti-Classifier (N-variant paraphrase fan-out with 5-feature heuristic scoring: TTR, sentence-length variance, burstiness, punctuation entropy, length naturalness; explicit "no calls to GPTZero / Originality.ai / Copyleaks" design decision).
- **Vault drawers** per tool with 309 bundled OSS-licensed seed items (96 glitch tokens, 38 adversarial suffixes, 40 indirect-injection patterns, 17 tool-result lab fixtures, 20 PromptCraft chains, 50 fuzzer seeds, 15 emoji carriers, plus per-benchmark customs). Custom-add modal persists user items under `cryptex.vault.<toolId>`. Schema-versioned for forward migrations. License posture hard-locked to MIT / CC0 / CC-BY-4.0 / Apache-2.0.
- **Typed error taxonomy.** Discriminated `CryptexError` union (`network / cors / auth / provider / rate_limit / bad_input / tool / worker / storage_quota / local_server_offline / unknown`). `errorLogger.report()` funnels to toast + history + console. `ErrorPanel` component surfaces retry / dismiss.
- **Web Worker offload.** `runInWorker` dispatcher: in-thread under 50 KB, pool-of-4 module workers between 50 KB and 1 MB, throws `Errors.badInput` above 1 MB. AbortController cancellation via `worker.terminate()`.
- **Persistent searchable history.** Hybrid localStorage index + IndexedDB payload with localStorage fallback (50-entry cap). Auto-prune at 4 MB soft cap. `/history` global route with JSON + Markdown export, search across input / output / annotation, pin, annotate, replay (query-param navigation).
- **Unified `ToolShell` template** applied uniformly across all 25 tool surfaces. Status badge (Ready / Running / Done / Error / Cancelled), built-in Cancel, optional Vault slot, `HistoryFooter` at the bottom, automatic `<svelte:head><title>`.
- **Multi-step orchestrators** in PromptCraft with home-rolled SVG visualization (~5 KB bundle vs 40-120 KB for D3 / svelte-flow): TAP tree, PAIR timeline, Crescendo thread, Many-Shot grid.
- **Emoji stego** full Unicode mode set: variation selectors (U+FE0E / U+FE0F per-bit), tag block (U+E0020 + 4-bit nibble), combining marks (6-bit groups U+0300+). Any emoji as carrier (ZWJ + skin tones via `\p{Emoji_Presentation}`). Forensics decoder side-by-side.
- **Fuzzer** 4 advanced strategies on top of the 7 basic: grammar-mutation, synonym-replacement (WordNet-lite ~55 entries, CC-BY-4.0), prompt-injection-mutation (via PromptCraft registry), structured-noise (regex-targeted).
- **Local provider support** without BYOK keys: Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, Llamafile, NVIDIA NIM.
- **`/history`** global searchable + replayable run log.
- **CLAUDE.md v2.0 conventions** block documenting the ToolShell pattern, Vault drawer schema, error taxonomy, Web Worker dispatch, history v2 entry points, and the mandatory yellow heuristic-banner copy for benchmark pages.

### Changed
- `sessionLog.record()` calls fan out to `history.record()` via a fire-and-forget compat shim. All 13 existing call sites stay working without edits; every operation now persists to the v2 store and surfaces in `HistoryDrawer` + `/history`.
- `HistoryDrawer` rewritten to read from the v2 store with debounced search, three reinterpreted tabs (This session / Pinned / All), per-entry hover actions (Open / Replay / Pin / Annotate), inline annotation editor, quota soft-cap banner, dual JSON + Markdown export.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- Vite dev server `/api/_proxy/<providerId>/...` server-side passthrough so `/v1/models` works for every provider regardless of CORS.
- `presetRequiresKey()` helper plus `hasAnyConfiguredProvider()`. Local providers (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp) now run without an API key.

### Fixed
- DeepSeek and LM Studio model-list fetch failing under browser CORS.
- Local providers being treated as unconfigured even when their URL was set.
- `npm audit` cleaned 12 advisories to 0 via targeted upgrades (Vite, SvelteKit, Vitest, cookie override).
- `package-lock.json` regenerated to fix missing peer-dependency resolutions.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-09

Initial open-source release.

### Added
- 159 transformers in `src/transformers/` (encoding, classical ciphers, Unicode lookalikes, steganography, ancient scripts, fantasy alphabets, format tricks).
- 25 tool surfaces: 10 technique workbenches (`/transforms`, `/decode`, `/emoji`, `/gibberish`, `/tokenizer`, `/tokenade`, `/bijection`, `/fuzzer`, `/promptcraft`, `/anticlassifier`) + 15 red-team labs under `/redteam/*`.
- Multi-provider BYOK gateway (OpenRouter, Anthropic direct, OpenAI-compatible endpoints).
- 36 mutators, 8 classifier-evasion techniques, 4 composites, 3 conversation modes.
- Python CLI (`cryptex-cli`) reusing the same 159 transformers via Node bridge.
- Docker image + Dokploy-tuned `docker-compose.yml` + strict-CSP `nginx.conf`.
- MIT license.
